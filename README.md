# MicroURL BackEndðŸ”—

For Full Documentation, Please refer [here](https://github.com/tengfone/urlshortener)

### Backend

Either on local or cloud

```

git clone https://github.com/tengfone/urlshortener_be

cd urlshortener_be

npm install

```

Please ensure that you have a ```.env``` file located at the root directory that consist of the following params:

```

HOST=YOURDBHOSTURL

USER=YOURDBUSER

PASSWORD=YOURDBPASSWORD

DB=YOURDBNAME

PORT=3306

```

Then you can ```node server.js``` to start the backend server.

  

The front end is written using NodeJS running Express [here](https://github.com/tengfone/urlshortener_be)

  

The Backend has also been modularized so as to easily append new method APIs in the future. However, it is noted that currently I am serving the backend using http and not https, this is because I can only self-sign the certificate and certain browsers rejects self-signed API calls. To solve this problem is a matter of having a signed certificate. However due to time constraints, I will just serve the API via http.

  

## Testcase

### Backend

  

Run via ```npm run test```

  

Libraries for API testing:

- Chai

- Mocha

  

There are a total of 4 test cases.

#### Create

  | Test Case # | Description | Test Scenario | Test Steps | Test Data | Expected Results | Actual Results | Pass / Fail |
|-|:-:|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Check if MySQL is online and able to log in | Check if able to establish to connection to MySQL | 1. Retrieve Authentication Data for MySQL 2. Check if the result is an object | HOST=TargetHost USER=TargetUser PASSWORD=TargetPassword DB=url PORT=3306 | An Object | Object Returned | Pass |
| 2 | Sending new data into MySQL with no errors | Check if able to populate the data into the MySQL server | 1. Connect to MySQL 2. Generate a random B62 8 character URL which will also be used in Test Case 3. 3. Generate an object filled with data 4. Send to MySQL 5. Check status code if returns 500 | { LongURL:"http://www.google.com" ShortURL:customB62GeneratedURL TimeCreated:"2021-06-19 16:52:50" TimeExpire:"2021-06-19 16:52:50" } | Status Code 200 | Status Code 200 | Pass |
| 3 | Sending a duplicated key data into MySQL | Check if able to detect that the key has already existed in MySQL | 1. Connect to MySQL 2. Use the random B62 8 character URL generated in test case 2 to send a GET request to the server 3. Check if status code is 520 | ShortURL:customB62GeneratedURL | Status Code 520 | Status Code 520 | Pass |
  

#### FindURL


| Test Case # | Description | Test Scenario | Test Steps | Test Data | Expected Results | Actual Results | Pass / Fail |
|-|:-:|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Search if alias correspond to longURL found in MySQL | Ensure that there is a slug/alias inside the DB called test mapped to a full URL. Valid if it returns a status code of 200 | 1. Ensure there is a mappable key pair value in the DB 2. Send a GET request with the key parameter | ShortURL=test | Status code 200 | Status code 200 | Pass |
